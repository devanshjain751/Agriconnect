          </h3>
          <p className="text-white mb-4">Remove dirt, mud, and plant residue from tools immediately after use to prevent rust and wear.</p>
          <p className="text-white mb-4">Always store tools in a dry, covered area to avoid moisture damage and corrosion.</p>
          <p className="text-white mb-4">Keep blades on tools like sickles, hoes, and cutters sharp for efficient performance and safer handling.</p>
          <p className="text-white mb-4">Apply oil to hinges, joints, and metal parts to prevent rust and ensure smooth movement.</p>
          <p className="text-white mb-4">Check tools for cracks, loose handles, or bent parts and repair or replace as needed before the next use.</p>
          <p className="text-white mb-4">Avoid using tools for tasks they’re not designed for—this prevents unnecessary stress and breakage.</p>
